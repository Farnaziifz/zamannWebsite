Our specialists have first-class technical knowledge about the software and can support your company from the first steps in development, through to ongoing support for your business following implementation.</div><div class="options-desc" id="rollout"><p>Establishing a training concept during the deployment phase is decisive for users’ future satisfaction and for them working in an efficient way. Problems in this section can lead to serious consequences during the hypercare phase, which may not just cause show stoppers, but may also endanger the entire establishment of the system. To reduce the insecurity of the users to a minimum as well as to completely eliminate potential risks, the harmonisation of the development and deployment phase is vital as part of a carefully adjusted and mature training concept.</p><p>Our expertise includes the creation of user concepts to be considered when specifying the configuration and during the development phase, as well as the production of training materials and e-learning modules and the preparation, training and support of users and corresponding user communities.</p><p>Even long-established systems often have plenty of room for improvement in this area and can later be modified and improved.</p></div><div class="options-desc" id="organization"><p>An established GxP system needs a lot of support. The complexity of the system and its processes inevitably lead to plenty of queries from the users. The numerous possible combinations of fields, user rights, interfaces and process procedures regularly lead to new requirements and scenarios, which were not covered or sufficiently taken into account during the development phase. Processes must be modified and configurations must be reconsidered. The organisation running the system is generally responsible for its operation and for ensuring compliance.</p><p>The main responsibilities of the organisation running a system include communication with the users and potential key or power users, providing support to the corresponding user groups and passing on queries as part of global business support. To register queries, to forward them and process them, a company-specific tracking or ticket system is required which also permits extensive evaluation.</p><p>Our experience in this field allows us to quickly categorise questions, to introduce corresponding processes if necessary, and to send the user a satisfactory answer as quickly as possible. This area also includes so-called incident and bug handling, which requires quick and effective processing when things get serious and which represents an important part of the services which we provide.</p></div><div class="options-desc" id="demand"><p>The subjects that arise during business support often lead to modifications and optimisation of processes and of the system itself. Users can also notify the organisation running the system of their own ideas and supply requests for changes, to suggest measures which would increase efficiency. Demand management involves pre-filtering the corresponding optimization options, to filter out the practicable suggestions and to prevent an excess of change requests and associated work.</p><p>Pre-filtered suggestions (demands) are discussed together with the process owner concerned and the IT department. As necessary they will be modified, will be correspondingly prioritised and organised as part of the release management, which summarises all changes into packages for implementation in the system and prepares them for the preceding validation. Such changes inevitably lead to modifications to the training material, which has to be permanently updated and which, as required, can lead to mandatory retraining of users.</p><p>Our experts have many years of experience in this field and can make use of a wide spectrum of technical knowledge, permitting practical demand planning and controlled releases of your application.</p></div><div class="options-desc" id="project"><p>Managing projects competently and intelligently is our passion.</p><p>Our project leaders combine deep compliance expertise with high‐class project and change management. This allows us to create intelligent success through processes and solutions that are quickly adapted by the organization and that efficiently guarantee the fulfillment of the legal framework requirements.</p><p>Our experienced staff supports tasks such as Software Implementation, GxP Process Adaptation, CAPA Management, Complaint Handling, Change Control or Document Control. Different operational models are possible, e.g. managed services which are adapted to your needs.</p></div><div class="options-desc" id="validation"><p>CSV (Computer System Validation) is the process of ensuring that any technology component (software or hardware) is fulfilling its purpose in line with the regulatory guidelines for a certain industry. It is especially crucial in FDA-regulated industries like biotech and pharma, since products from these sectors impact public health and safety.</p><p>It’s essential to maintain quality standards in pharma since non-conformance can have far-reaching consequences. Computer system validation checks the effectiveness and the efficiency with which the system is meeting the purpose for which it was designed.</p><p>At Zamann Pharma Support, we can assist you with setting up a CSV schedule within your company, as well as all your other validation and qualification needs.
